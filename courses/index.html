		<h3>Courses:</h3>
		
		<p>All our organised groundschools will be taking place at <a href = "/dropzone/">Skydive Hibaldstow</a> in North Lincolnshire over the entire weekend.</p>
		<ul class = "bullet">
			<li>We travel from York to the dropzone together on the Friday evening, before relaxing in the bar and spending the night in the bunkhouse</li>
			<li>The groundschool will then take place on Saturday from 8:00am onwards and last a minimum of 6 hours</li>
			<li>We then relax on Saturday evening and socialise at the bar before bedding down in the bunkhouse</li>
			<li>We get up bright and early on Sunday to complete a 'refresh' to test your memory on the groundschool the day before. You then gear up and get ready to complete your first ever solo jump! (Weather permitting)</li>
			<li>We then return together to York on the Sunday evening after an eventful weekend</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>We currently offer one solo course: <b>Accelerated Freefall (AFF)</b>.</p>
		
		<ul class = "bullet">
			<li>In this course you'll be jumping from 15,000ft from the first jump, having a full minute of freefall!</li>
			<li>AFF takes a minimum of 18 successful jumps, at the end of which you'll recieve your British SKydiving A licence</li>
			
		</ul>
		
		<p>The groundschool consists of approximately 6 hours plus training in the classroom. Your instructor will take you through everything you will need to know, including all of the emergency procedures and a comprehensive guide to all of your equipment. They will take you through the ‘routine’ that you will be required to do for your first jump, practising in mocked up versions of the aircraft’s exit. You will work on perfecting your body position and your landing pattern, and you will be given a complete tour of the airfield.</p>
		
		
		<button class = "accordion">Accelerated Freefall (AFF)</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<img class = "course-image" src = "../images/courses/course_aff.jpg"></img>
			<p>This course is the fastest way to achieve the solo skydiving A License and can give you the thrill of freefall from your very first jump. You will be taken straight up to the giddy heights of 15,000ft and will exit from the plane solo with 2 instructors holding on to you to guide you in freefall. You will receive in-air feedback to correct your body position and then, at the right altitude, you will then deploy your own parachute.</p>
			<p>To complete this course you will need to pass 8 Levels of skydives completing various skills usefull in freefall e.g. backflips and turns and then 10 consolidation jumps where you practice your skills.</p>
			
			<ul class = "bullet">
				<li>Level 1: First jump with two instructors</li>
				<li>Level 2: Second jump with two instructors</li>
				<li>Level 3: The two instructors let go and you maintain a stable position and heading</li>
				<li>Level 4: Small turns (drops down to one instructor)</li>
				<li>Level 5: 360 turns</li>
				<li>Level 6: Unlinked exit, back loops and tracking</li>
				<li>Level 7: Complete Unlinked exit, back loop, 360 turns in both directions and tracking</li>
				<li>Level 8: Hop 'n' Pop from 5,000ft</li>
				<li>Consolidation jumps (x10): Practice all your skills solo</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Training weekends for this course will be run on demand so if you like the sound of it then please <a href="/contact/">contact us!</a></p>

			<p>Tandem parachuting allows you to experience the thrill of freefall skydiving without any extensive training and is a great way to venture into the sport or raise some money for charity!</p>
			<p>After a short 20 minutes tandem briefing, you will jump harnessed to the front of a fully qualified parachuting instructor from 15,000ft. From this height, you will enjoy one whole adrenaline-fuelled minute of freefall reaching terminal velocity at 120mph!</p>

			<p>Don't fancy jumping out of a plane? Want a cheaper experience? why not experience the thrill of freefall in the safety of an indoor wind tunnel! We run trips to the tunnel in Manchester throughout the year from as little as £30. If you're interested, then please email us directly!</p>

		<h3>Post 'A' License:</h3>
		
		<h4><b>Formation Skydiving</b></h4>
			
		<p>After completing either the static line or AFF solo courses you will be a fully qualified solo skydiver! This means that you can safely skydive anywhere in the world! However, doing a lot of solo skydives can become a bit boring (believe it or not!) and so most students then progress onto doing the <b>Formation Skydiving Grade 1</b> course. This is a series of around 10 jumps where you will skydive with a highly qualified coach who will teach you skills on how to move around the sky relative to other people i.e. forwards/backwards, side-to-side and many more. After successfully demonstrating the skills you will complete a 3-way and 4-way skydive and then will be awarded your Formation Skydiving Grade 1. From here the sky is the limit and you can jump with anyone else with this qualification, including most of the committee! This is the ultimate achievement as it means you can skydive with all your friends and then can even enter national competitions!</p>
