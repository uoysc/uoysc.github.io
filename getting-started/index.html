    <p class = "q_answer">Both courses lead you towards your Skydiving 'A' licence. This means you can skydive completely solo without the guidance of an instructor anywhere in the world! Learning doesn't end here with plenty of disciplines to get into such as formation skydiving with your friends or progressing towards your B licence.
